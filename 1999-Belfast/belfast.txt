Hello Jose,

Rooms booked for those nights. You will be the first to arrive. I come
later on Saturday.

Ah, but you never sent me your FAX number until now :-)

I have attached 3 maps. 2 jpg and a pdf. Maybe that will be easier than
FAX.

You are booked in at:

The Queen's Common Room, 
1 College Gardens,
Belfast 7

It is right at the bottom of the map bestmap.jpg

PCs Ram 32Mb
14 for students plus 1 for lecturer with LCD projector
14" screens Windows 95, MS Office 97, Netscape etc
all machines on network. All the machines have 
Powerpoint97

Plus the usual white board, OHP etc.

If you land at the International airport, there is a regular bus into
the city. Get to the bus station and then get a taxi to the Common room.
You might find they have put your keys over with the security guard in
the main building, but its only across the road. This is in case there
is no-one around when you arrive .... or something. Leave a message at
the bar to say where you are, I will come and find you when I arrive. I
think I will be there around 10 p.m. ...cannot quite remember and cannot
see my tickets at the moment.

If you arrive at the City airport ... just get a taxi. I have never
landed there, so I can say no more.

Advice I was give for the international airport on last visit was:

   "   .... you are booked into our QUB
Common Room for sun night. You must collect the door key from the
Security
Hut at the Lanyon Building - this is the main building of the university
and is on University Road about half a mile from the Bus Station. The
security man will direct you to the Common Room about 50 yards away at
the
top of College Gardens. Your best way from the airport is to get the
Airbus (runs approx every 30 min) and either walk or take a taxi from
the
terminus to the university. ...... "

See you there. Email if any problems. I go to Birmingham tommorrow and
then Nottingham, but will be reading email here and there.
