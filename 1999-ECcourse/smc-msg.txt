Dear friend,

        we are contacting you now with further details about the course

5th to 9th October 1999. In this message you will find financial details

as well as an overall schedule of the course and some travel planning
tips. Please read all through it and let us know if you have any doubts.




APPLICABLE COSTS

        As you already know, you have been admitted to this course. The
costs are as already advertised:

        - 300 Euro (50000 ESP) for academic students

        You qualify as an academic student if you are a student (e.g.

COURSE SCHEDULE

        The course is to begin on October the 5th, and end on October
the
9th.

        You may find details on how to come to our Center on our WWW
pages

                http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/training/smc99/

        Getting to the CNB may be a bit complex the first time. The
campus
of the University Autonoma de Madrid is big and finding us may take some

questioning the first time. For this reason, we have reserved the
morning
of the first day for receptions. Plan on expending half an hour at the
"metro", another half on the train/bus, and another half in finding us
to
be on the safe side.

        We will wait for you all along the morning of October the 5th,
and expect you all to be here no later than 12 o'clock noon. On arrival
you must check at the counter at the entry of the building where we
shall
be waiting for you. We will have a little introductory talk and go
for lunch by 13:00. On the afternoon we'll start straight ahead with the

course.

        The course will last "four days". Since we start the lectures on

the 5th afternoon, this means that we shall finish on the morning of
October 9th, by noon or lunch time.


WHAT TO BRING

        We'll provide you with a CD-ROM containing all the course
materials,
some training and tutorial information and some software packages.

        In addition we'll provide you with printed material for the
tutorials and exercises. You may wish to take some notes during the
lectures.

        Weather in Spain in October is usually mild. It is normally warm

during the day and may get a bit cold during the nights. Temperatures
usually range from 15 to 25 degrees Celsius, and might occasionally get
chilly (10 C). While not common, we might also have some odd rainfall,
so
bringing a raincoat may not be a bad idea at all.

        Electricity in Spain goes at 220 Volts, 50 Hz AC, using
continental
plugs. You may need an adapter if coming for other countries.

        Credit cards: all major credit cards are accepted almost
anywhere
in Spain (Visa, MC, AmEx, etc...) plus you will find lots of ATMs
everywhere. Traveler Checks may easily be cashed in any bank, and
opening hours are usually 8:00-13:00h

        Of course, you may also bring along somebody with you. Besides
lots of museums and cultural interest places, Madrid provides in these
dates a broad range of activities in its Fall Festival: theater,
concerts,
etc... take place during all the Autumn. And of course, there is a
flourishing night life constantly going on.

        We may provide details on the cultural and leisure activities
available if you (or your company) are interested in them. Just let us
know.

        We are also planning on a get together party one day during the
course. At this stage we still haven't decided on the details, and will
probably postpose it until you are all together here.


LOCAL EXPENSES

        If you want to plan on your travel expenses, here are a few tips

(note: 1 Euro = 166.386ESP ~= 1 USD):

        - Travelling in Madrid: the most comfortable way is to use the
tube (Metro). You only need to buy one ticket for any travel and this
allows you to switch trains as many times as you want until you go to
your destination. Taking the bus you must purchase a ticket for each
trip.

        Since you will be here several days, it is advisable to purchase

a
10-trip metrobus bonus. Costing 680 ESP (~4 Euros) it allows you to
travel
ten times by metro (with any amount of switching) or bus (no switching
included).

        - Arriving in Madrid: if you come by plane, you may go from the
airport to your accommodation by various means:
                - taxi: costs around 2000-3000 ESP (12-18 Euros)
                - bus downtown: leaves you at centric Plaza de Colon,
costs
        about 600 ESP (~3.6 Euros). From there you would have to take
        further buses, the metro or a taxi.
                - metro (underground): recently opened, will take you
        anywhere from the airport at a minimal cost. I'm not sure if it
        might have any special fare, in principle it should cost 160 ESP

        (~1 Euro) unless you buy a 10-trip bonus. Is the fastest and
cheapest
        way.

        - Getting to the campus: you may come by bus or train. Bus is
more
expensive and can only be taken at "Plaza de Castilla" or by the
Hospital
"Ramon y Cajal". It is better if you come by train, which you can take
at a number of stations (see map in the course web pages) and will cost
you 135 ESP (~0.8 Euro) one-way. You may purchase two-way tickets
(cheaper)
and 10-trip bonus (even cheaper). It usually takes 15-30 minutes from
downtown.

        - Breakfast: if you don't have it included in your accommodation

costs, we'd advise to have it here, where it's 125 ESP (0.75Euro) cheap.

Coffee breaks are also planned during the course.

        - Lunch: we'll have lunch at the campus everyday. Cost of lunch
at the CNB is 500 ESP (~3 Euros). There is a problem with lunch the last

day, since being a Saturday our canteen is closed. You may consider
going back downtown (there is plenty of time, lunch hours in Spain are
normally 13:00 - 16:00). Nevertheless, we are looking for feasible
possibilities. Let us know if you have any special food requirements so
we can check with our canteen staff.

        - Dinner: dining in Madrid may be from very cheap to rather
expensive.
If you go to a restaurant for a regular dinner it may cost you easily
between
1000-3000 ESP (~6-18 Euros). However, getting out for tapas, or being a
bit
careful in your selection of sites may possibly cost you less and be
more
fun. We'll try to give more advice once you are here. Dining time
usually
starts at 20:00-21:00 in Spain.

        - Others: getting out in Madrid may be cheap or expensive
depending
on where you go and what you do. We'll be pleased on giving you advice
once
you are here. Museums normally cost about 500 ESP, cinemas 750 ESP,
concerts
2000 ESP, a drink in trendy, fashionable places usually starts at
500ESP.
Going out for "tapas" several people gathers and asks for a few dishes
to
share, a glass of beer/wine (small "tapa" included) usually costs
125ESP, a
good wine (e.g. Rioja) 250 ESP, and a "racion" (big "tapa") 500-1000ESP.

        Service should always be included by law in all prices at public

places,  (unless clearly advertised, which rarely happens, look for
"Servicio
10% no incluido" in the menu). Taxes like IVA (VAT) are usually included

in
prices too, but sometimes aren't, look for tags like "IVA 12% no
incluido".

        TIPPING is just a matter of taste: around here, you normally
leave
nothing or just small change unless you feel very satisfied with the
service
(then you leave a small amount) or exceptionally happy: 1-5% is normally

plenty in this case.

        Bargaining is rarely done in Spain, prices are fixed in most
places
except perhaps some hotels and markets.


SECURITY

        Madrid is in general a very safe place, but like in any big city

you
may encounter the odd pickpocket, more specially if you clearly look
like
a tourist with lots of money and a careless attitude.

        No special precautions are needed in general, but like anywhere
in the World, please look after your luggage, do not carry big amounts
of
money clearly visible on the back pocket of your trouser hanging half
way
out with a sticky note saying "pick me", nor leave your valuables
uncared
of everywhere yo go while you look to the oppsite side. Be careful
retiring
money from ATMs at night. You get the idea.

        Only take official taxis. They are white, with a red stripe on
the
side and a box on top with a green light on one side, a yellow light on
the
other, "taxi" on writing and a display of zone fares in application (A,
B,
C...). Drivers must carry their license at sight, as well as official
fares,
and a "taximeter" must clearly display the running cost of the trip.


WE WAIT FOR YOU

        Nothing more for now. We will be waiting for you here on the 5th

October in the morning. Please, try to be here before noon. We wish you
a nice trip and an enjoyable estance in Madrid.
