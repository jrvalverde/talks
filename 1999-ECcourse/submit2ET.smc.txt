    	-------------------------------------------------------
	Total:	    	      1,464,000 ESP 	(8798.82 Euros)

    NOTE: Cost estimation in Euros has been calculated using the fixed
    official exchange rate of 1 Euro = 166.386 ESP


DESCRIPTION   

     Detailed description of 
                      + Objectives, 
	
	The goal is to enhance user assistance in their institutions
	for scientific researchers who have a local computing facility
	but no staff trained in Biology or Bioinformatics.
	
	As such the course is addressed to Computer Scientists who are
	in charge of the computing facilities at a research institution
	and need to offer their users access to bioinformatics tools.
	
	The course should include a practical application of all the
	concepts shown. After completion, assistants should have achieved
	and be able to reproduce the following tasks:
	    - installation of major sequence analysis packages (GCG or
	    Staden, Phylip, SRS, AceDB,...)
	    - installation of WWW interfaces (W2H, WWW2GCG)
	    - knowledge of existing databases and their interest
	    - mirroring and updating of databases
	    - SRS indexing
	    - installation of a Blast or Fasta server
	    - installation of basic documentation on bioinformatics
	    - knowledge of basic problems of system maintenance on
	    Bioinformatics.
		
	Most examples given will try to use EMBnet material, services and
	sources to increase awareness of EMBnet.

	
                      + Workplan, 

	The course should be publicly announced by April, with advertising
	material being distributed by May to research centers, universities
	and scientific societies.

	Applications will be accepted until mid June, and then we'll
	start the selection process, notifying accepted assistants by
	end of June, beginning of July.

	The course will accept about 10-15 assistants, which will be
	selected among the applicants. Applications will be accepted from
	all of Spain and EMBnet countries and selection will be made
	based on interest and utility of the course contents for the
	applicants and the impact on their institutions.

	Speakers should also have been selected and compromised by then.
	We have some suggestions as to proposed speakers, but kindly
	request the E&T PC assistance and suggestions on the selection
	of speakers.

	Arrival of speakers is expected the night before the start of the
	course and they will stay through the course until its end. 
	Theoretical lectures will take place at CNB show room and
	practical sessions will take place on facilities of the
	University Autonoma de Madrid.


                      + Scientific information

	Students will be exposed to a broad introduction to Bioinformatics,
	with a short introduction to the algorithms employed and the
	interpretation of the results obtained. 
	
    	A description of the strains induced by the special nature of
	Bioinformatics on computer systems and of the special system
	management techniques required to efficently manage a Biocomputing
	site will be central to the lectures.
	
	Assistants will learn about scientific sources of data, such as
	databases, and documentation like tutorials of interest to their
	users. They will learn how to install and maintain these data and
	how it is structured.
	
	Specific tasks include the installation of program packages. This
	requires some undertanding of available software and development 
	of minimum critical abilities to select packages of interest which
	should be soundly founded on a good grasp of the core concepts of
	Bioinformatics.

     b) in case of courses
                 a) invited lecturers:
    
    	There will be 4 lecturers, three of them visiting lecturers from other 
    	EMBnet nodes. 
	Prospective speakers have yet to be contacted. Help and
    	suggestions from E&T PC would be mosty welcome.
    	Initially we would like to propose the following lecturers:
	    	Jose R. Valverde
	    	Martin Bishop
	    	Marc Colet
	    	Peter Rice

                 b) Task of lecturer 1:
                    Task of lecturer 2:
                    ...................

    	Depending on election and approval of lecturers, we will assign 
	teaching tasks to each acccording to their expertise for the
	morning theoretical lectures. In the evening lecturers will divide
	in two groups of two each that should take care of a student
	group in a separate computer room to guide them in the practical
	sessions.
