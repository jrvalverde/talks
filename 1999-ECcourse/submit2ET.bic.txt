DESCRIPTION   

     Detailed description of 
                      + Objectives, 
	
	Objective of the course is to present a general overview of
	current state of the art in bioinformatics, trying to cover the
	most fundamental aspects of the discipline from a user's point 
	of view.
	
	After the course is finished, users should have a knowledge of
	the kind of problems that can be tackled with the use of Bioinformatics,
	and introductory experience in the use of basic tools in each of
	the approached fields.
	
	A side bonus is to increase visibility of EMBnet as a whole and
	EMBnet/CNB in particular, its goals and services among the
	community.
	
                      + Workplan, 
	
	The course should be publicly announced by April, with advertising
	material being distributed by May to research centers, universities
	and scientific societies.
	
	Applications will be accepted until mid June, and then we'll
	start the selection process, notifying accepted assistants by
	end of June, beginning of July.
	
	The course will accept a total of 60 assistants, which will be
	selected among applicants. Applications will be accepted from
	all of Spain and EMBnet countries and selection will be made
	based on research interests and applicability of the course to the
	work of the applicant until availability of places is exhausted.
	
	We have broken down assistants into various categories considering
	their relationship to our insitution, distinguishing among CNB
	staff, EMBnet/CNB subscribers, external academics and commercial
	scientists. We will attepmt to keep a compromise balance in the 
	selection of assistants from each category.
	
	Speakers should also have been selected and compromised by then.
	We have some suggestions as to proposed speakers, but kindly
	request the E&T PC assistance and suggestions on their selection.
	
	Arrival of speakers is expected the night before the start of the
	course and they will stay through the course until its end. Theoretical
	lectures will take place at CNB show room during the morning. On
	the evenings students will be divided in two groups of 30 forthe
	practical sessions which will take place on facilities of the
	University Autonoma de Madrid.
	
                      + Scientific information
		      
	Uses will be exposed to a groad introduction to Bioinformatics,
	with a short introduction to the algorithms employed and the
	interpretation of the results obtained. 
	
	The course shall cover Sequence Analysis, from assistance in the 
	design and planification of experiments to final analysis and 
	interpretation of data gathered in the lab. That includes 
	identification of genes, assignment of functional and structural 
	properties and derivation of useful conclusions for guiding 
	future additional work.
	
	Evolutionary analysis will be introduced as an additional tool
	to gather extra information on sequence and organisms, but also
	as a way to understand more complex analysis methods of genes
	and proteins.
	
	A descrition and analysis of most popular databases available in
	Molecular Biology, their interest, utility, structure, usage
	and search methods will be provided to ensure that students
	know of available data sources and how to take advantage of them
	for their research work.

     b) in case of courses
                 a) invited lecturers:
    
    	There will be 4 lecturers, three of them visiting lecturers from other 
    	EMBnet nodes. 
	Prospective speakers have not yet been contacted. Help and
    	suggestions from E&T PC would be mosty welcome.
    	Initially we would like to propose the following lecturers:
	    	Jose R. Valverde
	    	Jack Leunissen
	    	Roberto Lopez
	    	Rob Harper

                 b) Task of lecturer 1:
                    Task of lecturer 2:
                    ...................

    	Depending on election and approval of lecturers, we will assign 
	teaching tasks to each acccording to their expertise for the
	morning theoretical lectures. In the evening lecturers will divide
	in two groups of two each that should take care of a student
	group in a separate computer room to guide them in the practical
	sessions.
